[The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) is a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, Express, Node and MongoDB based on the Rick and Morty TV show. You will have access to data about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is full of canonical information as seen in the TV series. It seeks to implement concepts of data management, population, filtering and schema development for both GraphQL and MongoDB with Mongoose.
